# UI5 Walkthrough Template

This repository can serve as a template for the UI5 Walkthrough. You can start with the first step of the tutorial. To run your app exceute the command

```bash
npm run start
```

The app will open automatically. When you do changes to your code, just refresh the page in your browser to see their effect. If you still see no changes it is often helpful to clear the browser cache and reload the page in the browser.

In step 10 of the Walkthrough you will be asked to create a `manifest.json`. You will find that this file already exists here but you can just replace its content with the content provided in the Walkthrough.
